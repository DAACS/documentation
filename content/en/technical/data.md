DAACS uses a Mongo database for storing all data in the system. Mongo is a [nosql](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained), document based system. For research and predictive modeling purposes, this data will need to be converted to table(s) (also to ingest into relational databases). This section will provide an overview of the data structures used as well as utility queries and R functions to work with DAACS data.
