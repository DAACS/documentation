You can either import assessments (in JSON format) or create a new assessment from scratch. DAACS supports four types of assessments:

1. **Multiple choice** - This assessment allows for any number of multiple choice questions. Students will be presented all questions in the pool.
2. [**Computer Adaptive Test (CAT)**](/technical/assessments/cat/) - This assessment uses a *computer adaptive testing* framework. Details are provided below.
3. **Likert** - This assessment presents the students with Likert response items.
4. [**Writing**](/technical/assessments/writing/) - This assessment presents the student with a text box to provide a written response. Written responses can be scored manually (located in the Admin -> Ungraded Assignments menu) or automatically using Lightside models. Details on training models is provided below.
