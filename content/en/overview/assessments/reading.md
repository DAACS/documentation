The reading assessment is designed to assess critical reading skills necessary to be successful in college. Feedback is organized across five subdomains: ideas, inference, language, purpose, and structure. Students are encouraged to review the resources available on [Excelsior College's Online Reading Comprehension Lab](https://owl.excelsior.edu/orc/) which was developed as part of the DAACS [FIPSE First in the World](/acknowledgments/) grant.
