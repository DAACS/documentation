The mathematics assessment is a computer adaptive test that is designed to assess the content necessary to determine whether students are reading for college mathematics and at which level. Items were drawn from past [New York State Regents exams](https://www.nysedregents.org), the [Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System](https://www.doe.mass.edu/mcas/), and pre-calculus items were previously used by the University at Albany to determine readiness for calculus. Feedback is organized across six subdomains: geometry; lines and functions; number and calculation; statistics; variables and equations; and word wroblems.
