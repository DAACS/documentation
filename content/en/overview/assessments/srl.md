The self-regulated learning (SRL) assessment was development by the DAACS team and the psychometrics were published in [Lui et al (2018)](http://www.futureinstitute.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Future-Review-Online-Article-1.1.pdf). It is comprised of self-report Likert itemms. The SRL assessment was updated in 2022 to expand on self-efficacy to include self-efficacy for mathematics, reading, and writing. Below are the items from the current version of the assessment.
