The [my.daacs.net](https://my.daacs.net) provides a feature for instructors to use DAACS with students in your course. This section will outline the steps to create classes, invite students to your class, and downloading results.

If you plan to use DAACS with your students, we recommend reviewing the [overview](/overview) and [advisors](/advisors) sections first as they will provide valuable information for successfully integrating DAACS into your course.
