The [my.daacs.net](https://my.daacs.net) site has a feature for instructors to use DAACS within their classes. With an instructor account you can create classes, invite students to your class, and view their results (once the student has accepted the invitation).

Instructor accounts cannot complete assessments so you may want to create two separate accounts, one as a student and one as an instructor.

To get started, click the `CREATE ACCOUNT` link in the upper right corner and fill in the dialog box. Be sure to select "Instructor" for the role.

With an instructor accunt you will have a `CLASSES` link available. You can create a new class from this page. When creating a class give it a name and select the assessments you wish to use.
