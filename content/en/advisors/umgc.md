## Frequently Asked Questions

### Success Coaches & Military Education Coordinators (MECs)

{{< expand "If only half of the new students will be using DAACS in Fall 2022 and they will be randomly assigned, how do I know if a student I’m working with is using DAACS??" >}}
If a student has a DAACS summary report in Salesforce, that student has been assigned to the DAACS treatment group and has done the required assignment in PACE. If there is no summary report by week 3, either the student is in the control group (no DAACS) or has not yet done the assignment—you’d have to ask.
{{< /expand >}}


{{< expand "When will students in the treatment group use DAACS?" >}}
For half of the PACE courses, DAACS is part of the Week 2 assignment. It involves two tasks:
1) After using DAACS at [url], they upload their DAACS summary reports to the course.
2) They then participate in a discussion of their own and their peers’ reflections on the DAACS feedback.
{{< /expand >}}


{{< expand "What am I expected to do with DAACS in my role as coach or coordinator?" >}}
We ask that you do two things:
1) Remind those with DAACS summary reports in Salesforce that students who use DAACS tend to do significantly better
in college than students who do not and encourage them to take full advantage of the resources at the website.
2) Review at least the first page of the 3-page summary reports and use the results and suggestions in advising.
{{< /expand >}}


{{< expand "What is in the summary reports in Salesforce?  How can they be useful to me?" >}}
The summary reports include 1) overall results for the reading, writing, math and self-regulated learning (SRL) assessments with tips and hyperlinks to helpful resources, 2) students’ written reflections on their SRL results, and 3) detailed SRL survey results. You can urge students to employ the tips and use the resources to prepare for success.

### PACE Instructors

{{< expand "Only half of the PACE sections will be using DAACS in Fall 2022, and they will be randomly assigned. How do I know if my section is assigned to DAACS?" >}}
 In the sections assigned to the DAACS treatment group, the assignment for Week 2, “Learning how to Learn,” will require students to use DAACS by completing the assessments, reviewing the results and feedback, and discussing their results with their peers in the course. If, in contrast, the Week 2 assignment is the familiar assignment, your section was randomly assigned to the control group, which we call “business as usual.”
{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "How do students receive credit for their Week 2 assignment if they are in a DAACS section of PACE?" >}}
Students will receive credit for the Week 2 assignment by completing two tasks:
1) After using DAACS at [url], they upload their DAACS summary reports to your course.
2) They then participate in a discussion of their own and their peers’ reflections on the DAACS feedback.
See the Week 2 assignment in your course for details.

{{< expand "How do we know whether students have completed DAACS? What am I expected to do if they haven’t completed it?" >}}
If students upload their summary reports, they completed the DAACS assessments. We ask that you email students who have not yet done the assignment, as you normally would, using text we will provide. [Martina Hanson] will also send one separate nudge to all students as a reminder.{{< /expand >}}

{{< expand "I’d like to review students’ DAACS results and feedback to guide my conversations with them. How can I access them?" >}}
 The summary reports uploaded by students will give you an overview. You can access detailed results and feedback by registering as an instructor at the UMGC DAACS website: [url]
