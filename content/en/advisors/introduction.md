When getting aquanted with DAACS, we recommend that you first take the assessments to see what the student experience is like. You can create an account at [my.daacs.net](https://my.daacs.net) (**be sure to select the student role when creating an account**). We suggest beginning with the self-regulated learning assessment followed by writing. Once you complete the assessment, browse your feedback and explore some of the suggested resources and reflect on the strategies recommended.

	C.	Math, Reading, SRL, and Writing  
	D.	Motivation, Reading, Strategies, and Writing

{{< expand "Click for the answer" >}}
**Answer: C**. DAACS assesses three of the critically important skill areas for college students: reading, writing, and mathematics. However, the as important domain of self-regulated learning (SRL) is assessed. It is important to consider a student's SRL skills in conjunction with their academic results. For example, research has shown that highly motivated students are very likely to be successful in a course regardless of their baseline content knowledge, especially in mathematics.

5.	John, a student, comes to you with this concern about DAACS: "DAACS is using up a lot of time that I do not have. Why do I have to complete all of it before I start my classes?"" Given the purpose of DAACS, which of the following is the most appropriate with which you can respond?  (SELECT ALL THAT APPLY)

	A.	DAACS is a diagnostic assessment, which is meant to assess what you already know at the start of your studies.  
	B.	DAACS takes the role of placement exams, to help us place you into appropriate classes and identify your need for remedial coursework.  
	C.	DAACS is designed to provide you with targeted feedback and resources to help move you ahead to become a self-regulated learner.  
	D.	You are right. DAACS is a waste of time. Don’t finish it.

{{< expand "Click for the answer" >}}
**Answer: A and C**. DAACS was designed for newly enrolled students, so A is correct. It is also designed to provide targed feedback based upon the student's responses, making C correct. However, students can retake the assessments at anytime. They may find their SRL results to vary depending on their current context.

6.	Avery, a student, wants to take advantage of what DAACS offers to students, but does not know where to start. She reaches out to you for suggestions. Which of the following is the best initial response you could give? (SELECT ALL THAT APPLY)

	A.	 "Identify two or three areas that you’d like to work on, perhaps areas where you earned only one DAACS circle. Read the feedback for these areas closely, and choose one or two strategies per area that you can realistically do."  
	B.	"Read through all of the feedback first and take notes on what you think is most important to you. Make a plan of how you can work on the areas you have identified while reading feedback. Then set up an appointment with me and we can meet to discuss."  
	C.	 "Review the essay you wrote for the writing assessment. Commit to improving on the areas you have written about, and use the strategies you have identified as strategies to try for the next couple of weeks. Make sure to monitor your progress when you are using your strategies to see if and how they are working for you."

{{< expand "Click for the answer" >}}
**Answer: ANY**. These are all reasonable strategies for working with a student. Some students may feel overwhelmed by the amount of information, for them identifying only a few areas to review may work best for them. However, given the time it is worthwhile for a student to review all the feedback, especially areas where they received three DAACS dots. These are strategies for which they are mastering and may want to rely on those strategies when the semester gets difficult. Lastly, reviewing what strategies the student identified when initally completing DAACS provides an opportunity for them to reflect on their learning and to recalibrate, if necessary, and to either recommit to those strategies or identify new ones to help them be successful.
