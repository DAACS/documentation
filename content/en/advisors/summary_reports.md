We have developed a three page summary student report to provide the most essential information about a students performance on DAACS. The first page provides a summary of the students performance on all four assessments with essential resources they can use. The second page provides the students' essay and the third page provides more details about the students' self-regulation learning results with strategies selected based upon their results. Although this was initially designed to help academic advisors, this is a useful document to share with students. Below is an example status report.
