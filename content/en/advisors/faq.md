{{< expand "How is DAACS different from admission tests such as the SAT and ACT?" >}}
The ACT and SAT are high stakes assessments often used by determine whether to admit a student or not. Recent research suggests that these are a poor predictor of student success and in there is evidence that they exasperate racial biases in higher education. *DAACS is designed for a learning purpose.* There are no stakes to DAACS. Our own research has shown that DAACS is a better predictor of freshman GPA than the SAT/ACT. Students are provided with detailed feedback, based upon whether they are at the developing, emerging, or mastering level, across a multitude of domains associated with college success.
