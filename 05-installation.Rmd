# Part II - Technical Specifications {-}

Part two of this manual will describe the technical details about deploying DAACS.

## Application Architecture

## Application Dependencies
The DAACS application relies on external services, in order to function. These are services that the institution must provision and configure; they are not services provided by the DAACS application. The most important services is user authentication via Single-Sign-On (SSO) with SAML. 

### Single-Sign-On (SSO)
DAACS application behavior is driven by the user's role. To authenticate users and present the appropriate application behavior, your institution must have a SSO capability that can exchange SAML messages. Those SAML messages must contain information regarding the user's role.

## Hosting Environment
DAACS was designed to be easily deployed to a cloud-hosting environment. The author assumes the use of Amazon cloud services. However, the reader may safely choose any environment capable of operating the required version of the Linux operating system (e.g. other virtualization technology, physical platform, etc.).

## Installation
The DAACS application has been tuned to service large volumes of students, on relatively modest hardware, be that hardware virtual or physical.

This manual assumes that the reader is familiar with Amazon Web Services EC2 and has an established AWS environment. For more information regarding getting started with AWS, please see <a href'"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html">Amazon AWS setup</a>

Generic Steps to install DAACS:

1. Create AWS EC2 instance
2. Select the proper Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and install the image
3. Java install
4. Docker install
5. System configuration
6. Install daacsweb and daacsapi Docker containers
7. What am I missing?

### Step 1. Create AWS Instance
The DAACS application has been tuned to service large volumes of students, on relatively modest virtual hardware.

### Step 2. Select the proper Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and install the image

### Step 3. Java install

### Step 4. Docker install

Since Docker is a required technology, some of the system requirements are driven by the Docker requirements. For accurate information regarding Docker requirements, please reference:
