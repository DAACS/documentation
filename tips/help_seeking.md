#### [Help Seeking](https://srl.daacs.net/learning-strategies/help-seeking/)

* Identify and write down the specific things that give you trouble, and ask your advisor for suggestions for getting assistance.
* At the start of a course, ask your teacher and advisor about the best ways to contact them (e.g., office hours, email, course website, phone call).
* Advocate for yourself â€“ be persistent if your first attempt to get help is not successful.
