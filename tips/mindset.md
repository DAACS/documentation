#### [Mindset](https://srl.daacs.net/motivation/mindset/)

* Think of a challenge as an opportunity to learn rather than something to overcome.
* View mistakes as a natural part of learning.
* Pay attention to the things you say to yourself. Remind yourself that you can improve if you just keep trying.
