Students can also complete the assessments across multiple sessions and feedback is mobile friendly.    Which areas of college skills does DAACS cover/assess?\nA.\tHistory, Math, Reading, and Science\nB.\tMath, Reading, Science, and Writing\nC.\tMath, Reading, SRL, and Writing\nD.\tMotivation, Reading, Strategies, and Writing\n  Click for the answer ↕  Answer: C. DAACS assesses three of the critically important skill areas for college students: reading, writing, and mathematics. However, the as important domain of self-regulated learning (SRL) is assessed. It is important to consider a student’s SRL skills in conjunction with their academic results. For example, research has shown that highly motivated students are very likely to be successful in a course regardless of their baseline content knowledge, especially in mathematics.    Which areas of self-regulated learning does DAACS cover/assess? (SELECT ALL THAT APPLY)\nA.\tMetacognition\nB.\tStrategies for Learning\nC.\tMotivation\nD.\tSelf-Efficacy\n  Click for the answer ↕  Answer: ALL OF THE ABOVE. These are the main areas of the self-regulated learning (SRL) assessment.    John, a student, comes to you with this concern about DAACS: \u0026ldquo;DAACS is using up a lot of time that I do not have. Why do I have to complete all of it before I start my classes?\u0026rdquo;\u0026quot; Given the purpose of DAACS, which of the following is the most appropriate with which you can respond? (SELECT ALL THAT APPLY)\nA.\tDAACS is a diagnostic assessment, which is meant to assess what you already know at the start of your studies.\nB.\tDAACS takes the role of placement exams, to help us place you into appropriate classes and identify your need for remedial coursework.\nC.\tDAACS is designed to provide you with targeted feedback and resources to help move you ahead to become a self-regulated learner.\nD.\tYou are right. DAACS is a waste of time. Don’t finish it.\n  Click for the answer ↕  Answer: A and C. DAACS was designed for newly enrolled students, so A is correct. It is also designed to provide targed feedback based upon the student’s responses, making C correct. However, students can retake the assessments at anytime. They may find their SRL results to vary depending on their current context.    Avery, a student, wants to take advantage of what DAACS offers to students, but does not know where to start. She reaches out to you for suggestions. Which of the following is the best initial response you could give? (SELECT ALL THAT APPLY)\nA.\t\u0026ldquo;Identify two or three areas that you’d like to work on, perhaps areas where you earned only one DAACS circle. Read the feedback for these areas closely, and choose one or two strategies per area that you can realistically do.\u0026rdquo;\nB.\t\u0026ldquo;Read through all of the feedback first and take notes on what you think is most important to you. Make a plan of how you can work on the areas you have identified while reading feedback. Then set up an appointment with me and we can meet to discuss.\u0026rdquo;\nC.\t\u0026ldquo;Review the essay you wrote for the writing assessment. Commit to improving on the areas you have written about, and use the strategies you have identified as strategies to try for the next couple of weeks. Make sure to monitor your progress when you are using your strategies to see if and how they are working for you.\u0026rdquo;\n  Click for the answer ↕  Answer: ANY. These are all reasonable strategies for working with a student. Some students may feel overwhelmed by the amount of information, for them identifying only a few areas to review may work best for them. However, given the time it is worthwhile for a student to review all the feedback, especially areas where they received three DAACS dots. These are strategies for which they are mastering and may want to rely on those strategies when the semester gets difficult. Lastly, reviewing what strategies the student identified when initally completing DAACS provides an opportunity for them to reflect on their learning and to recalibrate, if necessary, and to either recommit to those strategies or identify new ones to help them be successful.

DAACS is a suite of open source, online assessments and supports (both technological and social) designed to optimize student learning (see https://daacs.net/). DAACS has five main components (Figure 1): (1) diagnostic assessments that permit valid and reliable inferences of students’ readiness for college in terms of self-regulated learning, reading, writing, and mathematics; (2) performance feedback with recommended strategies and links to open educational resources, (3) nudges that prompt students to engage in self-directed preparation for college-level academic work; (4) trained academic advisors who help students build on strengths while addressing areas of weakness identified by the assessments; and (5) predictive models that identify students at risk, as well as specific risk factors. Detailed descriptions of each component are provided after the following summary of initial research results.\n  Warning DAACS is not a placement exam! The D in DAACS stands for diagnostic. It was designed to provide feedback to students and institutions and provide the resources for students to become more successful learners.

In recognition of this issue, the What Works Clearinghouse (Bailey et al., 2016) recommended six strategies for helping students in developmental education. With one exception (offering students monetary incentives), the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) intervention reflects each recommendation (Appendix C-1): 1) using multiple measures to assess readiness, 2), requiring participation in enhanced advising activities, 3) compressing developmental education by mobilizing targeted supports for students’ specific needs, 4) teaching students how to become self-regulated learners, and 5) implementing comprehensive, integrated, and long-lasting support programs. The key objective of the current proposal is to rigorously evaluate the effects of DAACS on proximal behavioral measures (e.g., use of resources, help seeking), as well as distal measures of academic progress and student achievement.\nDAACS (https://daacs.net/) is a fully developed, online, free, open-source system with a research-based theoretical framework and promising results from randomized controlled trials of the beta version. As noted above, DAACS reflects the WWC strategies for helping students. It entails multiple measures to assess academic readiness via free, online diagnostic assessments of academic skills (i.e., reading, mathematics, and writing) and self-regulated learning (SRL) processes (i.e., metacognition, use of learning strategies, motivation). The assessments are automatically scored so students receive immediate feedback and access to website links with freely available, targeted supports for students’ specific needs. The SRL and writing assessments provide feedback and guidance for students on how to become self-regulated learners. In order to support participation in enhanced advising activities, the project includes professional development for advisors and online features such as DAACS dashboards to enable easy access to concise summaries of students’ individualized needs and to useful resources. By being integrated into the organizational structure of participating universities and available to students anytime, anywhere, DAACS is a long-lasting support program with field-tested features to ensure student participation.\nDeveloped with the support of a Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) First in the World Grant (FITW; 2016-2019; Grant #P116F150077), DAACS was designed to address persistent problems with college readiness and the limitations of remedial or developmental education. According to The Nation’s Report Card (NCES, 2015), 75% of all high school seniors were unprepared for post-secondary coursework in mathematics, and 63% were unprepared for coursework in reading. Of the 1.8 million high school students who took the ACT in 2019, almost 40% failed to meet any of the four ACT College Readiness Benchmarks (ACT, 2019). Many students who resort to college readiness programs still undertake remedial coursework in college: A Community College Research Center report notes that 68% of community college students and 40% of students at public four-year colleges took at least one remedial course, with an annual cost to all college students nationwide of approximately $7 billion (Jaggars \u0026amp; Stacey, 2014). Unfortunately, numerous studies that show remedial coursework to be ineffective, unnecessary for the majority of students, and associated with negative outcomes such as increased cost, time to degree, and attrition (e.g., Attewell et al., 2006; Bailey et al., 2010).\nDAACS provides an alternative to remedial coursework by offering students the opportunity to access information about their level of college readiness and free resources to use to become better prepared on their own while enrolled in credit-bearing courses. In addition, DAACS can be used by college administrators to boost the accuracy of predictions regarding students who may be in the greatest need of supports and services (Bryer et al., 2019).\nThe beta version of the DAACS system was rigorously evaluated using randomized controlled trials at two online institutions that serve predominantly non-traditional students (n = 21,381). Although the results of the RCT revealed overall null effects on on-time progress and credit acquisition, it was observed that students who actually utilized DAACS feedback showed statistically significant gains in completing their first six months of coursework on-time and were more successful in earning credits than students who only completed the assessments (Bryer et al., 2019). Further, we used the final year of our current FIPSE project to develop new DAACS features, including participation nudges and an advisor dashboard. The purposes of the proposed project are to examine the efficacy, predictive power, and cost effectiveness of the new, fully developed DAACS system across a variety of postsecondary institutions that enroll both traditional and non-traditional college student populations. As a result, we will be able to determine which students are most likely to benefit from the intervention and how that information can help institutions help their students.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/overview/assessments/srl/","title":"Self-Regulated Learning","parent":"Assessments","content":"The self-regulated learning (SRL) assessment was development by the DAACS team and the psychometrics were published in Lui et al (2018).

Below are the items from the current version of the assessment.\nMetacognition  Metacognition     Planning      I think of several ways to solve a problem and choose the best one. I think about what I really need to learn before I begin a task. I ask myself questions about assigned readings before I begin. I think about the best ways to complete assignments before I begin them. When I study for a test, I think about the types of questions that might be on it.  Monitoring      I ask myself periodically if I am meeting my goals. I find myself analyzing the usefulness of my study strategies while I study. I ask myself questions about how well I am doing while I am learning something new. I consider several alternatives to a problem before I answer. I find myself pausing regularly to check my comprehension. I ask myself if what I\u0026rsquo;m reading is related to what I already know.  Evaluation      I ask myself if I learned as much as I could have once I finish a task. I ask myself how well I accomplished my goals once I\u0026rsquo;m finished. I summarize what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned after I finish.   Motivation  Motivation     Anxiety      During important exams, I think that I am doing awful or that I may fail. During important exams, I cannot remember material that I knew before the exam. The closer I am to a major exam, the harder it is for me to concentrate on the material. When I study for my exams, I worry that I will not remember the material on the exam.  Mastery Orientation      I find coursework enjoyable. I want to master the things I am learning. What I am learning is relevant to my life. Learning is fun for me.  Mindset      You can always change how intelligent you are. Your intelligence is something about you that you can\u0026rsquo;t change very much. You can learn new things, but you can\u0026rsquo;t really change your basic intelligence. No matter how much intelligence you have, you can always change it quite a bit.   Strategies  Strategies for Understanding     Help Seeking      I ask others for help when I don\u0026rsquo;t understand something. I ask questions about things I don\u0026rsquo;t understand. I ask my instructor questions when I do not understand something. I look things up online to help me understand.  Managing Environment      I make sure no one disturbs me when I study. I try to study in a place that has no distractions (e.g., noise, people talking). I let people interrupt me when I am studying. I let electronic devices (e.g., television, cellphones) distract me when I am studying.  Managing Tie      When I have an upcoming test, I wait to the last minute to start studying for it. I pace myself while learning in order to have enough time. I finish all of my schoolwork before I do anything else. I use a calendar to organize my time to complete my schoolwork.

DAACS has five main components (Figure 1): (1) diagnostic assessments that permit valid and reliable inferences of students’ readiness for college in terms of self-regulated learning, reading, writing, and mathematics; (2) performance feedback with recommended strategies and links to open educational resources, (3) nudges that prompt students to engage in self-directed preparation for college-level academic work; (4) trained academic advisors who help students build on strengths while addressing areas of weakness identified by the assessments; and (5) predictive models that identify students at risk, as well as specific risk factors. Detailed descriptions of each component are provided after the following summary of initial research results.\nFigure 1. DAACS Framework and Components The associations between success in college and DAACS usage by students and advisors suggest that DAACS served its intended purposes for the students who were motivated to use it, while other students needed encouragement from the system and advisors (Bryer et al., 2019). In response, we developed several enhancements, including the SRL Lab (https://srl.daacs.net); a variety of nudges that prompt students to complete the assessments (Franklin et al., 2019), use the resources, and communicate with their advisors; and enhanced advisor training (Slemp et al., 2019) with an advising dashboard that succinctly summarizes students’ DAACS results and recommendations. DAACS is now ready for a rigorous test of its efficacy in promoting student success in terms of credit completion and retention, as well as its predictive power and cost effectiveness. In the remainder of this section we present detailed descriptions of the DAACS system, as well as evidence of validity, reliability, and efficacy, as appropriate (Table 1).\nComponent 1: Diagnostic Assessments     Many college students lack sufficient awareness of their learning strengths and weaknesses and the academic demands of college studies (Zimmerman et al., 2011). To enhance students’ knowledge of their academic and non-academic skills, DAACS includes diagnostic assessments of disciplinary content (reading, math, and writing) as well as SRL skills (metacognition, strategy use, motivation). Unlike placement exams, which provide only a pass/fail score and are used to place students into remedial courses, these diagnostic assessments provide students with information about their strengths and weaknesses prior to beginning college so they can build up weak areas while taking credit-bearing courses.\nSRL Survey. The SRL survey consists of 62 Likert-type items adapted from established SRL measures (Cleary, 2006; Driscoll, 2007; Dugan \u0026amp; Andrade, 2011; Dweck, 2006; Schraw \u0026amp; Dennison, 1994). The items cover three domains: metacognition, motivation, and learning strategies. The SRL assessment has excellent psychometric qualities, suggesting inferences drawn from the survey scores are valid and reliable (Lui et al., 2018).\nWriting assessment. The writing assessment asks students to summarize their SRL survey results, identify specific strategies for improving their SRL, and commit to using them. Thus, the writing assessment not only assesses writing skills, but also engages students in reflecting on and planning to develop their skills in SRL. An open source, automated essay scoring program was trained to reliably score the writing assessments in terms of nine criteria related to effective college-level writing (Yagelski, 2015) and provide students with feedback within one minute (Akhmedjanova et al., 2019; Andrade et al., 2018).\nMathematics and reading assessments. The mathematics and reading assessments are computer-adaptive tests with 18 to 24 multiple choice items adapted from state-mandated high school English language arts and mathematics exams, which are useful for identifying college readiness (Han, 2003; Jirka \u0026amp; Hambleton, 2005; Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, 2017; New York State Education Department, 2014a, 2014b). The DAACS reading and mathematics assessments have acceptable psychometric properties, including convergent and discriminant validity evidence, and acceptable internal consistency estimates.\nTable 1. Four DAACS Assessment Domains and Sub-Domains\n   Domain Sub-domains Reliability     Self-regulated learning Metacognition, motivation (anxiety, goal orientation, self-efficacy), learning strategies (help seeking, managing time, managing environment, strategies for understanding), mindset α = .79 - .91   Writing Content, organization, paragraphs, sentences, conventions Average LightSide-human IRR=66.3%   Mathematics Word problems, geometry, variables and equations, numbers and calculations, lines and functions α = .69   Reading Ideas, inference, language, purpose, structure α = .67    Component 2: Feedback and Resources     Three components of DAACS were designed to promote self-directed learning: (1) the immediate feedback students receive upon completing the diagnostic assessments, (2) links to Open Educational Resources (OERs) related to individual students’ results, and (3) nudges, or periodic encouragement to take advantage of the feedback, resources, and academic advisors. Details and sample feedback are provided in Table 2 and Appendix D, respectively.\nImmediate feedback. The feedback and resources provided to students by DAACS is an especially powerful and unique aspect of its design. Consistent with findings from research on formative feedback (e.g., Hattie \u0026amp; Timperley, 2007; Meer \u0026amp; Dawson, 2018; Shute, 2008; Wiliam \u0026amp; Thompson, 2007), DAACS feedback can increase student awareness of discrepancies between their current and desired skill levels, and provide suggestions about how to improve. As a result, students have a greater likelihood of enhancing performance and succeeding in school. Furthermore, feedback that guides adaptation is a hallmark of SRL theories (Efklides, 2011; Winne \u0026amp; Hadwin, 1998; Zimmerman, 2000), most of which depict SRL as a goal-directed, cyclical process whereby individuals set goals, plan, enact learning strategies, deploy monitoring techniques, and then evaluate and adapt (Boekaerts et al., 2000). DAACS represents a structured assessment-to-feedback system designed to enhance regulatory skills.\nOpen Educational Resources. Two new OERs were created with the support of the FIPSE FITW grant: the SRL Lab (srl.daacs.net) and the Reading Comprehension Lab (owl.excelsior.edu/orc). A library of pre-existing math-related OERs was also curated. Institution-specific resources, such as the Online Writing Lab, are also linked to feedback.\nTable 2. Four DAACS Assessment Domains, Sample Feedback and Resources\n   Domain Sample Feedback Sample Resources     Self-regulated learning Mindset: \u0026ldquo;The SRL assessment results suggest that you have a fixed mindset, meaning you tend to believe your intelligence cannot be changed over time. Although you might have a fixed mindset right now, you can change it to a growth mindset. That is, you can learn to think and act like your intelligence can be improved with effort.\u0026rdquo; Self-Regulated Learning Lab: https://srl.daacs.net/   Writing Transitions: \u0026ldquo;Your writing was scored at the developing level for transitions between paragraphs, which were missing or ineffective. Paragraphs tended to abruptly shift from one idea to the next.\u0026rdquo; Excelsior College’s Online Writing Lab: https://owl.excelsior.edu   Mathematics Statistics: \u0026ldquo;Your results suggest that you have emerging skills for reasoning with data. To further develop your skills at summarizing data with statistics, graphs, and tables, these resources might be a good starting point: \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Math is Fun: https://www.mathsisfun.com/   Reading Inferences: \u0026ldquo;Your results suggest an area of improvement for you is reading closely to determine implied meaning. A skill you may want to improve is the ability to draw logical inferences from what texts explicitly say to determine the implied meaning. An inference is\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Reading Comprehension Lab: https://owl.excelsior.edu/orc/    There is a modest but promising body of research on the effectiveness of OERs for improving student outcomes and reducing higher education costs (Hilton, 2016; Hilton et al., 2014). In a research review, Hilton (2016) found that students who use OERs generally have better or equal learning outcomes as compared to students using traditional learning methods. These results have been demonstrated across a variety of subjects and outcome variables. The review also indicated that student and faculty perceptions of OERS are very positive, with most preferring OERs over traditional learning materials. While there have been promising results regarding the effectiveness of OERs, some studies have found null effects (Grimaldi et al., 2019). While OERs are at least as effective as traditional, expensive learning materials such as textbooks, these resources can only have an effect if students actually access them. The nudges feature of DAACS was designed to increase student engagement with OERs.\nComponent 3: Automated Nudges     A major finding from our FIPSE study indicated that DAACS is only helpful to students who choose to not only take the assessments, but also access the feedback and resources (see Figures 2 and 3). In response to these findings, we developed and tested nudges to encourage more students to take advantage of the wealth of information and resources available to them via the DAACS. To nudge is \u0026ldquo;to alert, remind, or mildly warn another\u0026rdquo; (Thaler \u0026amp; Sunstein, 2008, p. 4). The nudges were informed by studies that demonstrated their effectiveness in influencing behavior. For example, the U.K. Nudge Unit sent letters to individuals who had not paid their taxes, the most effective of which read, \u0026ldquo;Nine out of ten people in the U.K. pay their taxes on time. You are currently in the very small minority of people who have not paid us yet.\u0026rdquo; Within 23 days, there was an increase of 15% in the number of people paying their taxes (Halpern, 2015). Similar nudges based on social norms have been shown to be effective in improving organ donor registrations (Thaler \u0026amp; Sunstein, 2008), decreasing cigarette smoking on college campuses (Perkins, 2003), and increasing elementary school students’ use of deliberate practice (Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2016).\nReminders are a type of nudge that prompts students to turn their attention to a particular problem or task, gives them easy access to information, and/or reminds them of the benefits of completing a task (Damgaard \u0026amp; Nielsen, 2018). These types of nudges have had a positive effect on several educational outcomes, including college enrollment for low income and first-generation students (Castleman \u0026amp; Page, 2017). Informational nudges aim to improve student outcomes by providing information about their behavior and ability, or by encouraging students to overcome barriers (Damgaard \u0026amp; Nielsen, 2018). Informational nudges aimed at improving students’ grit (Alan, Boneva, \u0026amp; Ertac, 2016), planning (De Paola \u0026amp; Scoppa, 2015; Yeomans \u0026amp; Reich, 2017), goal setting (Alan et al., 2016; De Paola \u0026amp; Scoppa, 2015), and time management (Bettinger \u0026amp; Baker, 2014; De Paola \u0026amp; Scoppa, 2015) have had positive effects on academic outcomes. Two of our nudges reflect social norms: They inform students of either the percentage of students from their school who have completed DAACS or the higher success rate of students who use DAACS. We also developed three reminder and informational nudges, including one that reminds students to re-read the essay they wrote for the writing assessment in order to recall the SRL strategies they committed to using; one that has a link to feedback on a domain on which they scored particularly low or high; and one encouraging students to complete the DAACS. Nudges are sent via email and include convenient links to the DAACS. The nudges resulted in a significant increase in students’ use of the DAACS (2 = 7.7, p \u0026lt; 0.05) and the feedback it provides (2 = 14.2, p \u0026lt; 0.01) (Franklin et al., 2019).\nComponent 4: Academic Advising     Students in postsecondary education are typically assigned an academic advisor who assists in course planning and problem solving (Bailey et al., 2016; Grubb, 2001). DAACS was designed to be an advising tool that enables advisors to access information about students’ academic strengths and weaknesses, use the information to focus advising conversations, and help students set actionable goals. A few studies that meet the WWC recommendations without reservations reported that college students who participated in enhanced advisement were likely to accumulate more credits than students in control groups (Bailey et al., 2016; Cousert, 1999; Scrivener \u0026amp; Weiss, 2013; Visher et al., 2010). In order to enhance advising, DAACS has a new advisor dashboard, and comprehensive professional development.\nAdvisor dashboard. BAU advising at our partner institutions requires students to meet with an advisor at least once per semester. Students in the treatment condition will meet with advisors who have easy access to the online dashboard in order to facilitate the use of DAACS results by advisors (Appendix D, pp. 9-10). The initial page presents a student’s scores on each assessment, as well as top strengths and weaknesses. Advisors can also easily access detailed information related to student outcomes, such as specific item responses, and can recommend strategies or links to appropriate resources.\nAdvisor professional development (PD). In-person and online trainings will enhance advisors’ knowledge of DAACS and the ways in which it can be used to promote student success (Appendix C-2). An emphasis is placed on the application of SRL strategies to academic contexts. The SRL workshop to be provided during the proposed study is an updated version of the workshop administered as part of the FIPSE grant. Evaluations of 36 advisors receiving the three-hour SRL workshop revealed statistically significant increases in their knowledge of SRL and self-efficacy for helping students (Cleary et al., 2019). The new version of the PD will involve advisors in considering case studies based on actual students, and role playing DAACS-based advising sessions. Advisors will also be invited to engage in action research related to inquiry questions they develop, supported by the DAACS research team. Regular contact between the team and advisors and their supervisors will allow for trouble-shooting, as well as identifying questions, concerns, and suggestions for augmentations to the DAACS.\nComponent 5: Predictive Modeling     As institutions serve more students with fewer resources, being able to identify academically at-risk students early in their programs and provide robust academic and motivational supports is critical. Beta-DAACS data increased the accuracy of models predicting student success in their first term by as much as 6.9% over baseline models (Bryer et al., 2020). This is valuable to institutions interested in prioritizing outreach to students and/or monitoring student progress upon beginning coursework.\nDAACS Theory of Change     Our theory of change is based on bioecological systems theory, which describes an environment as a “set of nested structures, each inside the next like a set of Russian dolls” (Bronfenbrenner, 1979, p. 3). Five interrelated layers surround a focal individual – microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, macrosystem, and chronosystem – and are arranged from systems having the most to the least direct impact on the individual’s development. The influences lie in the setting, individuals, and social interactions within and between these systems (e.g., Neal \u0026amp; Neal, 2013). As shown in Figure 1, our focal individual is the student, including cognitive capacities and socioemotional, and motivational tendencies. Academic advisors and institutions surround the students as part of the educational setting. DAACS components are designed to affect each level in the system, to strengthen interactions between systems and the influences that these interactions have on students’ educational experience.\nAs explained above, DAACS is a research-based intervention that integrates SRL, diagnostic assessments and feedback, social supports, open educational resources, nudges, and predictive modeling in the service of retention and success in higher education. Our logic model (Appendix C-3) summarizes the design of our proposed intervention and how it is expected to lead to short-term, intermediate, and long-term outcomes, at the student level and systemically. We posit that students, as the focal individuals, benefit from information about their academic strengths and weaknesses (e.g., Hattie \u0026amp; Timperley, 2007; Shute, 2008; Wiliam \u0026amp; Thompson, 2007), feedback about how to address deficits with links to useful resources (Hilton, 2016; Hilton, et al., 2014), and guidance from advisors who understand how to use students’ information and feedback during advising (Grubb, 2001). According to SRL theories (Efklides, 2011; Winne \u0026amp; Hadwin, 1998; Zimmerman, 2000), the information provided to students by DAACS will also promote the development of self-regulated learning.\nFeatures designed to leverage the feedback and resources made available by DAACS include nudges to students and advisors, and dashboards and training to guide DAACS-informed advisement. These features are intended to strengthen interactions between advisors and students. As a result, students will develop the skills necessary to persist in school, waste less time in remedial courses, earn more credits, and have higher GPAs. In addition, participating institutions will use DAACS data to more accurately identify students in need of extra support and to individualize the support they receive. As DAACS becomes more widely used, higher education practices will shift away from remediation and toward a more informative and supportive approach based on diagnostic assessment, feedback, and open educational resources.\nFigure 2. DAACS Logic Model "},{"id":10,"href":"/overview/assessments/writing/","title":"Writing","parent":"Assessments","content":"The writing assessment is designed for two goals: 1. Provide student feedback about their writing on criteria related to successful college writing; and 2. To get them to engage in the self-regulatory processes addressed in the self-regulated learning assessment. Students receive nearly instantaneous feedback since an automated scoring system is used (details on that system are located in the technical section. Below is the writing prompt and the scoring rubric.\nDAACS Writing Assessment Prompt      DAACS Writing Assessment Scoring Rubric     Please note that this is the rubric used for scoring. Students see a different rubric that uses growth language instead of deficiency language. It also identifies strategies and features they can use to make the essay better.\n   Criteria Developing (1) Emerging (2) Mastering (3)     Content: Summary The discussion of the survey and feedback is vague, poorly grounded in the survey results and feedback, and/or simplistic. The essay uses evidence from survey results and feedback to summarize and discuss strengths and/or weaknesses. The summary might be selective, under-developed in places, and/or lack sufficient detail, e.g., a lot of discussion of implications without much summary or vice versa. The essay includes a thorough, coherent, and detailed summary of SRL survey results and feedback and a discussion of what they indicate about the writer's strengths and weaknesses as a learner.   Content: Suggestions Choices of suggestions to which to commit are vague, if present at all, and/or only loosely connected to the survey results and feedback, if at all. The essay might refer to the continued use of current strategies but not to anything new related to the SRL feedback. Choices of suggestions to which to commit are discussed. The connections to the survey and feedback are present but might not always be explicit or logical. The explanation for committing to particular strategies might be thin. The discussion of suggestions for improvement in SRL is logically and explicitly related to the survey results and feedback, justified (\u0026quot;why you are committed to using those strategies\u0026quot;) and developed in sufficient depth.   Organization: Structure The structure of the essay is weak and/or illogical. Main ideas might be presented in a way that seems haphazard or disorganized. The essay has a general structure but may not have a clear overall organization that enables a reader to follow the progression of one idea to another. Note: One-sentence paragraphs do not necessarily reflect a problem with organization, but numerous such paragraphs might signal a weak structure. The essay is well-organized, with an order and structure that present the discussion in a clear, logical manner.   Organization: Transitions Transitions between paragraphs are missing or ineffective; paragraphs tend to abruptly shift from one idea to the next. Note: One-paragraph essays receive a 1 for this criterion. Paragraphs are usually linked with transitions, as needed. The transitions might be implied or strained, but the reader can follow along. Transitions between paragraphs are appropriate and effective, and strengthen the progression of the essay (e.g. \u0026quot;The second aspect . . .\u0026quot; \u0026quot;The last aspect . . .\u0026quot; and/or the repetition of important ideas and terms to connect paragraphs).   Paragraphs: Focus on a Main Idea Most or all paragraphs lack one clear, main point; might have several topics. Note: Numerous brief paragraphs of one or two sentences each might indicate a problem with paragraph focus and warrant a score of 1. Paragraphs are generally but not consistently focused on a main idea or point. One or more paragraphs lack or fail to maintain a clear focus in an essay in which most paragraphs maintain a clear focus. An essay can receive a score of 2 if there is a clear shift in ideas (i.e. the writer knows he/she is shifting topic), but no paragraph break. Paragraphs are consistently and clearly focused on a main idea or point. No one-paragraph essay should receive a score of 3.   Paragraphcs: Cohesion The connections between ideas in sentences within paragraphs are unclear. Little effective use of linking words and phrases. The ideas or information in each sentence within a paragraph are generally but not consistently linked together, if only loosely. Additional or better choices of linking words and phrases would clarify the connections b/w ideas within paragraphs. Within paragraphs, the individual sentences are seamlessly linked together; the reader can see the relationship between the ideas or information in one sentence and those in another sentence. The writing explicitly links sentences and ideas using adverbs (e.g., similarly, also, therefore), relative pronouns (e.g., who, that, which), conjunctions (e.g., and, or, while, whereas), and/or the repetition of key words, as appropriate.   Sentences: Correct Significant syntax problems, such as fragments and run-on sentences, are numerous enough to distract readers. Syntax problems are generally minor and may include awkward constructions, missing or unnecessary words, or transposed words. An essay can receive a score of 2 even if there are significant syntax errors, such as a fragments or run-ons, if those errors are rare and sentences are generally correct. There are no significant syntax problems. The writer is capable of managing even complex syntactic structures correctly.   Sentences: Complex The sentences lack syntactic complexity and vary little, if at all, in structure. The sentences tend to be relatively simple in structure, following a basic subject-verb-object pattern perhaps with a few additional elements, such as brief introductory phrases, prepositional phrases, or modifiers. Complex syntactic structures are present but may not always be managed effectively; sentence structures may be varied but are not often sophisticated. Consistent and appropriate use of a variety of sentence structures, including sophisticated sentence structures, such as complex, compound, or compound-complex sentences, and other complex syntactic forms, such as extended participial phrases and relative clauses.   Conventions: Punctuation Errors in punctuation are numerous enough to distract a reader and/or interfere with meaning. Patterns of punctuation errors may be evident, suggesting that the writer lacks an understanding of key rules for punctuation. Punctuation is generally correct. There may be errors but they are neither numerous enough nor serious enough to indicate that the writer lacks a basic understanding of the rules for punctuation. Punctuation is correct. Punctuation errors, if any, are common and very minor.

It uses the Lightside models to do the scoring.\n Training Data When creating a CSV file to use with Lightside, it must contain two columns named Score and text otherwise DAACS will not work.  When you first open Lightside, you will be presented with the screen below to load your data file (in CSV format) and to select what features you want extract. Be sure select NOMINAL for the score type and select text under text fields. The Lightside documentation provides details about each of the feature extraction options. Choosing the correct combination is a combination of theory (i.e. picking the features that are related to the criteria) and trial-and-error to obtain the highest accuracy. The table below provides details about which features were used for each criteria for our rubric.\n Once the features are extracted we move to the \u0026ldquo;Build Models\u0026rdquo; tab. Here, we will train a machine learning algorithm to predict the score from the extracted features. By default Lightside uses 10-fold validation to estimate fit statistics. The bottom middle provides the accuracy and Kappa and the lower right the full confusion matrix. A typical workflow involves checking the accuracy, returning to the \u0026ldquo;Extract Features\u0026rdquo; tab and change options, retrain the model, compare the accuracy, and repeat. Ideally you would have a separate validation dataset with which you would estimate fit statistics (e.g. accuracy, Kappa) against your final feature and model combination to report final estimates.\n Once you have decided on a final model, you can save the model using the save icon in the lower left side. The file saved is what you will upload to DAACS to conduct the machine scoring.\n Prediction File The model file may be very large. It is stored in XML format which can be opened in any text editor.

As you read it, try to imagine how the information, resources, and tips in the summary report might be used to support Jim as he begins college.\nNow that you’ve read Jim’s summary report, consider the questions below. Try to think about each question before clicking for more ideas. It might even help to jot down or type your answers in a separate window.\n Overall, what are your first impressions about Jim’s preparedness for college? What do you think are his greatest strengths, and what areas will be the most challenging?\nClick here for more ideas ↕  Overall, Jim seems very capable of succeeding in college. He has excellent writing skills, and has mastered many areas of math and reading. He also has the motivation needed to succeed. He struggled in a couple areas of math and reading, and needs to work on his metacognition and strategy use, as he mentioned in his essay. With some encouragement and support, Jim could use the feedback and resources offered by DAACS both before and during his first year of college to increase his chances for success.   What would you suggest Jim do to improve his math and reading skills?\nClick here for more ideas ↕  Jim could start by checking the reading and math items he got incorrect, and reviewing the explanations for the correct answers. He could also read the feedback he received, especially for the specific areas of math and reading he struggled with.\nJim might also use some of the free resources that are linked in the feedback and in his summary report (e.g., mathisfun.com, the Online Reading Lab, and more). Finally, Jim could benefit from some of the many resources available at your school, which are also listed in the first page of the summary report.\n  What did you learn from Jim after reading his essay and writing assessment results? What suggestions might you provide?\nClick here for more ideas ↕  After reading his essay and seeing his writing assessment results, we can see that Jim is a good writer, which will help him to succeed in college. If Jim wanted to improve or brush up on his writing skills, he could visit the Online Writing Lab, or any of the resources available at your school tailored towards assisting students with their writing.\nBased on the content of the essay, we can see that Jim is motivated to succeed and committed to utilizing the tips offered by DAACS to make this success happen. He made a solid plan of action to improve his metacognition, so you might consider following up with him to remind him of his plan, encouraging him to follow through on it.\nHe did not, however, make any plans to improve how he manages his time and environment. You might suggest a few strategies from the summary report, like keeping a calendar to improve his time management, and identifying a few good study places aside from his house. Some of the issues he is dealing with, especially in his home life, might be beyond his control, so it is important to empower him to find the best possible ways to cope with a difficult situation. A referral to your school’s counseling center might be appropriate, given some of the issues he mentioned in his essay.\n  What did you notice about Jim’s self-regulated learning results? What tips might you suggest to him to become a more self-regulated learner? Hint: check out the third page of the summary report.\nClick here for more ideas ↕  Jim already mentioned a few ways to improve his self-regulated learning in his essay, especially in regards to metacognition. However, there are more tips he can utilize, as you can see on the third page of his summary report, which identified a few tips for the three areas of self-regulated learning he struggled with most.   What did you notice about Jim’s self-efficacy? Consider not only his self-efficacy results from the self-regulated learning survey, but also what he wrote in his essay. How does Jim’s self-efficacy in reading, writing, and math match up with his performance in the reading, writing, and math assessments?\nClick here for more ideas ↕  Jim is clearly dealing with some self-doubt about his ability to perform well in college. This is evident from his self-efficacy results, which were low in all areas except for math. It’s important to encourage him by reminding him that with effort and support, he can achieve success in college.\nWe can also see that in Jim’s essay, he only focused on the areas that he struggled in. He could benefit from being reminded of his strengths as well, and encouraged to capitalize on these strengths. For example, his willingness to seek help, his growth mindset, and his ability to manage test anxiety will all play a major role in his time in college.\nHe also has more reading and writing ability than he is giving himself credit for. Although he had low self-efficacy for reading and writing, he did very well on the reading and writing assessments. Some students, like Jim, are more capable than they realize, and need encouragement to realize their potential and not give up on themselves. Jim’s growth mindset makes him more likely to benefit from such encouragement.\n  What questions would you want to ask Jim based on his DAACS results and essay?

Monitoring   \n   Ask yourself these questions while you listen to lectures, read texts, and watch videos: “Am I learning the material? Is anything getting in the way of my learning?” Make two lists: One list of tasks that you do well, and another of tasks with which you struggle. Then, explore the monitoring section of the SRL lab for recommendations for dealing with the tasks on the second list.\n   Planning   \n   Ask yourself questions before you begin a learning activity: “What am I expected to do? What approach to this work can help me do well?” Brainstorm multiple ways to approach an activity and then choose the best option. Ask your teachers questions about tasks and new material.    Strategies  Help Seeking   \n   Identify and write down the specific things that give you trouble, and ask your advisor for suggestions for getting assistance. At the start of a course, ask your teacher and advisor about the best ways to contact them (e.g., office hours, email, course website, phone call). Advocate for yourself – be persistent if your first attempt to get help is not successful.   Managing Environment   \n   Set rules about \u0026ldquo;do not disturb\u0026rdquo; times for others in your house. Turn off your cell phone and other technology. Identify 2-3 comfortable and quiet study places so you have multiple options.   Managing Time   \n   Set aside regular times to complete your work and stick to your schedule. Prioritize your assignments: Make sure you complete the most important tasks first. Estimate the time it takes to complete assignments and then check to see how accurate you were.   Understanding   \n   Study course material over several short study sessions rather than one long session. Use practice quizzes or tests to check your understanding of course material. Restudy only the material you got wrong. Elaborate on information by using concept maps or making summaries.    Motivation  Managing Test Anxiety   \n   Use relaxation techniques to reduce uncomfortable feelings and to increase your focus, as needed. Say positive things to yourself about your likelihood of success. Create schedules and plan study times so you don\u0026rsquo;t get anxious about being able to do what needs to be done.   Mastery Orientation   \n   Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about how others perform; focus on your own growth and learning. Focus on your improvement and progress rather than a single grade. View mistakes and errors as opportunities to improve.   Mindset   \n   Think of a challenge as an opportunity to learn rather than something to overcome. View mistakes as a natural part of learning. Pay attention to the things you say to yourself. Remind yourself that you can improve if you just keep trying.    Self-Efficacy  Self-Efficacy for Mathematics   \n   Feel prepared by practicing assignments and quizzing yourself when learning new information. When you are confused about something or don’t know how to proceed, ask for help from your professors, peers, advisor, or your college’s tutoring center.   Self-Efficacy for Online Learning   \n   Complete tutorials on how to use your learning management system (e.g., Blackboard, Canvas, Moodle). Get acquainted with the layout of your courses at the beginning of the semester, and do not hesitate to email your professor if anything is unclear or confusing.   Self-Efficacy for Reading   \n   Write down specific, short-term goals that you know are attainable, and note when you meet them. Identify a specific reading strategy you want to try out. Try it several times and reflect on how well it worked. If it didn’t help, try different strategies until you find one that works for you.

If there is no summary report by week 3, either the student is in the control group (no DAACS) or has not yet done the assignment—you’d have to ask.   When will students in the treatment group use DAACS? ↕  For half of the PACE courses, DAACS is part of the Week 2 assignment. It involves two tasks:\n After using DAACS at [url], they upload their DAACS summary reports to the course. They then participate in a discussion of their own and their peers’ reflections on the DAACS feedback.    What am I expected to do with DAACS in my role as coach or coordinator? ↕  We ask that you do two things:\n Remind those with DAACS summary reports in Salesforce that students who use DAACS tend to do significantly better in college than students who do not and encourage them to take full advantage of the resources at the website. Review at least the first page of the 3-page summary reports and use the results and suggestions in advising.    What is in the summary reports in Salesforce? How can they be useful to me? ↕  The summary reports include 1) overall results for the reading, writing, math and self-regulated learning (SRL) assessments with tips and hyperlinks to helpful resources, 2) students’ written reflections on their SRL results, and 3) detailed SRL survey results. You can urge students to employ the tips and use the resources to prepare for success.   Where can I find more information about DAACS? ↕  Visit us at https://docs.daacs.net for more information about DAACS. You can also contact [Susan?] at….   PACE Instructors     Only half of the PACE sections will be using DAACS in Fall 2022, and they will be randomly assigned. How do I know if my section is assigned to DAACS? ↕  In the sections assigned to the DAACS treatment group, the assignment for Week 2, “Learning how to Learn,” will require students to use DAACS by completing the assessments, reviewing the results and feedback, and discussing their results with their peers in the course. If, in contrast, the Week 2 assignment is the familiar assignment, your section was randomly assigned to the control group, which we call “business as usual.”   How do students receive credit for their Week 2 assignment if they are in a DAACS section of PACE? ↕  Students will receive credit for the Week 2 assignment by completing two tasks:\n After using DAACS at [url], they upload their DAACS summary reports to your course. They then participate in a discussion of their own and their peers’ reflections on the DAACS feedback. See the Week 2 assignment in your course for details.    How do we know whether students have completed DAACS? What am I expected to do if they haven’t completed it? ↕  If students upload their summary reports, they completed the DAACS assessments. We ask that you email students who have not yet done the assignment, as you normally would, using text we will provide. [Martina Hanson] will also send one separate nudge to all students as a reminder.   I’d like to review students’ DAACS results and feedback to guide my conversations with them. How can I access them? ↕  The summary reports uploaded by students will give you an overview. You can access detailed results and feedback by registering as an instructor at the UMGC DAACS website: [url]   Where can I find more information about DAACS? ↕  Visit us at https://docs.daacs.net for more information about DAACS.
