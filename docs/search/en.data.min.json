In recognition of this issue, the What Works Clearinghouse (Bailey et al., 2016) recommended six strategies for helping students in developmental education. With one exception (offering students monetary incentives), the Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills (DAACS) intervention reflects each recommendation (Appendix C-1): 1) using multiple measures to assess readiness, 2), requiring participation in enhanced advising activities, 3) compressing developmental education by mobilizing targeted supports for students’ specific needs, 4) teaching students how to become self-regulated learners, and 5) implementing comprehensive, integrated, and long-lasting support programs. The key objective of the current proposal is to rigorously evaluate the effects of DAACS on proximal behavioral measures (e.g., use of resources, help seeking), as well as distal measures of academic progress and student achievement.\nDAACS (https://daacs.net/) is a fully developed, online, free, open-source system with a research-based theoretical framework and promising results from randomized controlled trials of the beta version. As noted above, DAACS reflects the WWC strategies for helping students. It entails multiple measures to assess academic readiness via free, online diagnostic assessments of academic skills (i.e., reading, mathematics, and writing) and self-regulated learning (SRL) processes (i.e., metacognition, use of learning strategies, motivation). The assessments are automatically scored so students receive immediate feedback and access to website links with freely available, targeted supports for students’ specific needs. The SRL and writing assessments provide feedback and guidance for students on how to become self-regulated learners. In order to support participation in enhanced advising activities, the project includes professional development for advisors and online features such as DAACS dashboards to enable easy access to concise summaries of students’ individualized needs and to useful resources. By being integrated into the organizational structure of participating universities and available to students anytime, anywhere, DAACS is a long-lasting support program with field-tested features to ensure student participation.\nDeveloped with the support of a Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) First in the World Grant (FITW; 2016-2019; Grant #P116F150077), DAACS was designed to address persistent problems with college readiness and the limitations of remedial or developmental education. According to The Nation’s Report Card (NCES, 2015), 75% of all high school seniors were unprepared for post-secondary coursework in mathematics, and 63% were unprepared for coursework in reading. Of the 1.8 million high school students who took the ACT in 2019, almost 40% failed to meet any of the four ACT College Readiness Benchmarks (ACT, 2019). Many students who resort to college readiness programs still undertake remedial coursework in college: A Community College Research Center report notes that 68% of community college students and 40% of students at public four-year colleges took at least one remedial course, with an annual cost to all college students nationwide of approximately $7 billion (Jaggars \u0026amp; Stacey, 2014). Unfortunately, numerous studies that show remedial coursework to be ineffective, unnecessary for the majority of students, and associated with negative outcomes such as increased cost, time to degree, and attrition (e.g., Attewell et al., 2006; Bailey et al., 2010).\nDAACS provides an alternative to remedial coursework by offering students the opportunity to access information about their level of college readiness and free resources to use to become better prepared on their own while enrolled in credit-bearing courses. In addition, DAACS can be used by college administrators to boost the accuracy of predictions regarding students who may be in the greatest need of supports and services (Bryer et al., 2019).\nThe beta version of the DAACS system was rigorously evaluated using randomized controlled trials at two online institutions that serve predominantly non-traditional students (n = 21,381). Although the results of the RCT revealed overall null effects on on-time progress and credit acquisition, it was observed that students who actually utilized DAACS feedback showed statistically significant gains in completing their first six months of coursework on-time and were more successful in earning credits than students who only completed the assessments (Bryer et al., 2019). Further, we used the final year of our current FIPSE project to develop new DAACS features, including participation nudges and an advisor dashboard. The purposes of the proposed project are to examine the efficacy, predictive power, and cost effectiveness of the new, fully developed DAACS system across a variety of postsecondary institutions that enroll both traditional and non-traditional college student populations. As a result, we will be able to determine which students are most likely to benefit from the intervention and how that information can help institutions help their students.\nThe Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills Intervention     DAACS is a suite of open source, online assessments and supports (both technological and social) designed to optimize student learning (see https://daacs.net/). DAACS has five main components (Figure 1): (1) diagnostic assessments that permit valid and reliable inferences of students’ readiness for college in terms of self-regulated learning, reading, writing, and mathematics; (2) performance feedback with recommended strategies and links to open educational resources, (3) nudges that prompt students to engage in self-directed preparation for college-level academic work; (4) trained academic advisors who help students build on strengths while addressing areas of weakness identified by the assessments; and (5) predictive models that identify students at risk, as well as specific risk factors. Detailed descriptions of each component are provided after the following summary of initial research results.\nFigure 1. DAACS Framework and Components "},{"id":8,"href":"/01_overview/03_components/","title":"Components","parent":"Overview","content":"   Component 1: Diagnostic Assessments Component 2: Feedback and Resources Component 3: Automated Nudges Component 4: Academic Advising Component 5: Predictive Modeling      The associations between success in college and DAACS usage by students and advisors suggest that DAACS served its intended purposes for the students who were motivated to use it, while other students needed encouragement from the system and advisors (Bryer et al., 2019). In response, we developed several enhancements, including the SRL Lab (https://srl.daacs.net); a variety of nudges that prompt students to complete the assessments (Franklin et al., 2019), use the resources, and communicate with their advisors; and enhanced advisor training (Slemp et al., 2019) with an advising dashboard that succinctly summarizes students’ DAACS results and recommendations. DAACS is now ready for a rigorous test of its efficacy in promoting student success in terms of credit completion and retention, as well as its predictive power and cost effectiveness. In the remainder of this section we present detailed descriptions of the DAACS system, as well as evidence of validity, reliability, and efficacy, as appropriate (Table 1).\nComponent 1: Diagnostic Assessments     Many college students lack sufficient awareness of their learning strengths and weaknesses and the academic demands of college studies (Zimmerman et al., 2011). To enhance students’ knowledge of their academic and non-academic skills, DAACS includes diagnostic assessments of disciplinary content (reading, math, and writing) as well as SRL skills (metacognition, strategy use, motivation). Unlike placement exams, which provide only a pass/fail score and are used to place students into remedial courses, these diagnostic assessments provide students with information about their strengths and weaknesses prior to beginning college so they can build up weak areas while taking credit-bearing courses.\nSRL Survey. The SRL survey consists of 62 Likert-type items adapted from established SRL measures (Cleary, 2006; Driscoll, 2007; Dugan \u0026amp; Andrade, 2011; Dweck, 2006; Schraw \u0026amp; Dennison, 1994). The items cover three domains: metacognition, motivation, and learning strategies. The SRL assessment has excellent psychometric qualities, suggesting inferences drawn from the survey scores are valid and reliable (Lui et al., 2018).\nWriting assessment. The writing assessment asks students to summarize their SRL survey results, identify specific strategies for improving their SRL, and commit to using them. Thus, the writing assessment not only assesses writing skills, but also engages students in reflecting on and planning to develop their skills in SRL. An open source, automated essay scoring program was trained to reliably score the writing assessments in terms of nine criteria related to effective college-level writing (Yagelski, 2015) and provide students with feedback within one minute (Akhmedjanova et al., 2019; Andrade et al., 2018).\nMathematics and reading assessments. The mathematics and reading assessments are computer-adaptive tests with 18 to 24 multiple choice items adapted from state-mandated high school English language arts and mathematics exams, which are useful for identifying college readiness (Han, 2003; Jirka \u0026amp; Hambleton, 2005; Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, 2017; New York State Education Department, 2014a, 2014b). The DAACS reading and mathematics assessments have acceptable psychometric properties, including convergent and discriminant validity evidence, and acceptable internal consistency estimates.\nComponent 2: Feedback and Resources     Three components of DAACS were designed to promote self-directed learning: (1) the immediate feedback students receive upon completing the diagnostic assessments, (2) links to Open Educational Resources (OERs) related to individual students’ results, and (3) nudges, or periodic encouragement to take advantage of the feedback, resources, and academic advisors. Details and sample feedback are provided in Table 2 and Appendix D, respectively.\nImmediate feedback. The feedback and resources provided to students by DAACS is an especially powerful and unique aspect of its design. Consistent with findings from research on formative feedback (e.g., Hattie \u0026amp; Timperley, 2007; Meer \u0026amp; Dawson, 2018; Shute, 2008; Wiliam \u0026amp; Thompson, 2007), DAACS feedback can increase student awareness of discrepancies between their current and desired skill levels, and provide suggestions about how to improve. As a result, students have a greater likelihood of enhancing performance and succeeding in school. Furthermore, feedback that guides adaptation is a hallmark of SRL theories (Efklides, 2011; Winne \u0026amp; Hadwin, 1998; Zimmerman, 2000), most of which depict SRL as a goal-directed, cyclical process whereby individuals set goals, plan, enact learning strategies, deploy monitoring techniques, and then evaluate and adapt (Boekaerts et al., 2000). DAACS represents a structured assessment-to-feedback system designed to enhance regulatory skills.\nOpen Educational Resources. Two new OERs were created with the support of the FIPSE FITW grant: the SRL Lab (srl.daacs.net) and the Reading Comprehension Lab (owl.excelsior.edu/orc). A library of pre-existing math-related OERs was also curated. Institution-specific resources, such as the Online Writing Lab, are also linked to feedback.\nThere is a modest but promising body of research on the effectiveness of OERs for improving student outcomes and reducing higher education costs (Hilton, 2016; Hilton et al., 2014). In a research review, Hilton (2016) found that students who use OERs generally have better or equal learning outcomes as compared to students using traditional learning methods. These results have been demonstrated across a variety of subjects and outcome variables. The review also indicated that student and faculty perceptions of OERS are very positive, with most preferring OERs over traditional learning materials. While there have been promising results regarding the effectiveness of OERs, some studies have found null effects (Grimaldi et al., 2019). While OERs are at least as effective as traditional, expensive learning materials such as textbooks, these resources can only have an effect if students actually access them. The nudges feature of DAACS was designed to increase student engagement with OERs.\nComponent 3: Automated Nudges     A major finding from our FIPSE study indicated that DAACS is only helpful to students who choose to not only take the assessments, but also access the feedback and resources (see Figures 2 and 3). In response to these findings, we developed and tested nudges to encourage more students to take advantage of the wealth of information and resources available to them via the DAACS. To nudge is “to alert, remind, or mildly warn another” (Thaler \u0026amp; Sunstein, 2008, p. 4). The nudges were informed by studies that demonstrated their effectiveness in influencing behavior. For example, the U.K. Nudge Unit sent letters to individuals who had not paid their taxes, the most effective of which read, “Nine out of ten people in the U.K. pay their taxes on time. You are currently in the very small minority of people who have not paid us yet.” Within 23 days, there was an increase of 15% in the number of people paying their taxes (Halpern, 2015). Similar nudges based on social norms have been shown to be effective in improving organ donor registrations (Thaler \u0026amp; Sunstein, 2008), decreasing cigarette smoking on college campuses (Perkins, 2003), and increasing elementary school students’ use of deliberate practice (Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2016).\nReminders are a type of nudge that prompts students to turn their attention to a particular problem or task, gives them easy access to information, and/or reminds them of the benefits of completing a task (Damgaard \u0026amp; Nielsen, 2018). These types of nudges have had a positive effect on several educational outcomes, including college enrollment for low income and first-generation students (Castleman \u0026amp; Page, 2017). Informational nudges aim to improve student outcomes by providing information about their behavior and ability, or by encouraging students to overcome barriers (Damgaard \u0026amp; Nielsen, 2018). Informational nudges aimed at improving students’ grit (Alan, Boneva, \u0026amp; Ertac, 2016), planning (De Paola \u0026amp; Scoppa, 2015; Yeomans \u0026amp; Reich, 2017), goal setting (Alan et al., 2016; De Paola \u0026amp; Scoppa, 2015), and time management (Bettinger \u0026amp; Baker, 2014; De Paola \u0026amp; Scoppa, 2015) have had positive effects on academic outcomes. Two of our nudges reflect social norms: They inform students of either the percentage of students from their school who have completed DAACS or the higher success rate of students who use DAACS. We also developed three reminder and informational nudges, including one that reminds students to re-read the essay they wrote for the writing assessment in order to recall the SRL strategies they committed to using; one that has a link to feedback on a domain on which they scored particularly low or high; and one encouraging students to complete the DAACS. Nudges are sent via email and include convenient links to the DAACS. The nudges resulted in a significant increase in students’ use of the DAACS (2 = 7.7, p \u0026lt; 0.05) and the feedback it provides (2 = 14.2, p \u0026lt; 0.01) (Franklin et al., 2019).\nComponent 4: Academic Advising     Students in postsecondary education are typically assigned an academic advisor who assists in course planning and problem solving (Bailey et al., 2016; Grubb, 2001). DAACS was designed to be an advising tool that enables advisors to access information about students’ academic strengths and weaknesses, use the information to focus advising conversations, and help students set actionable goals. A few studies that meet the WWC recommendations without reservations reported that college students who participated in enhanced advisement were likely to accumulate more credits than students in control groups (Bailey et al., 2016; Cousert, 1999; Scrivener \u0026amp; Weiss, 2013; Visher et al., 2010). In order to enhance advising, DAACS has a new advisor dashboard, and comprehensive professional development.\nAdvisor dashboard. BAU advising at our partner institutions requires students to meet with an advisor at least once per semester. Students in the treatment condition will meet with advisors who have easy access to the online dashboard in order to facilitate the use of DAACS results by advisors (Appendix D, pp. 9-10). The initial page presents a student’s scores on each assessment, as well as top strengths and weaknesses. Advisors can also easily access detailed information related to student outcomes, such as specific item responses, and can recommend strategies or links to appropriate resources.\nAdvisor professional development (PD). In-person and online trainings will enhance advisors’ knowledge of DAACS and the ways in which it can be used to promote student success (Appendix C-2). An emphasis is placed on the application of SRL strategies to academic contexts. The SRL workshop to be provided during the proposed study is an updated version of the workshop administered as part of the FIPSE grant. Evaluations of 36 advisors receiving the three-hour SRL workshop revealed statistically significant increases in their knowledge of SRL and self-efficacy for helping students (Cleary et al., 2019). The new version of the PD will involve advisors in considering case studies based on actual students, and role playing DAACS-based advising sessions. Advisors will also be invited to engage in action research related to inquiry questions they develop, supported by the DAACS research team. Regular contact between the team and advisors and their supervisors will allow for trouble-shooting, as well as identifying questions, concerns, and suggestions for augmentations to the DAACS.\nComponent 5: Predictive Modeling     As institutions serve more students with fewer resources, being able to identify academically at-risk students early in their programs and provide robust academic and motivational supports is critical. Beta-DAACS data increased the accuracy of models predicting student success in their first term by as much as 6.9% over baseline models (Bryer et al., 2020). This is valuable to institutions interested in prioritizing outreach to students and/or monitoring student progress upon beginning coursework.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/03_instructors/","title":"Instructors","parent":"","content":""},{"id":10,"href":"/04_technical/","title":"Technical","parent":"","content":""},{"id":11,"href":"/02_advisors/08_ualbany/","title":"UAlbany","parent":"Advisors","content":"  Note The content on this page is specifically for individuals at the University at Albany.
